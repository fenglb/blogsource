几本介绍核磁共振成像的数据。
<!--more-->

“Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical and Biological Principles” by Stewart C. Bushong. A good introduction that does not demand a technical background from its readers.

"Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging” by Edelman, Hesselink and Zlatkin. Three volumes featuring a good mixture of technique and use. Not an intro, but a good follow-up (according to people who have read it. I haven’t).

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging – Physical Principles and Sequence Design” by Haacke, Brown, Thompson and Venkantesan. Broadly oriented textbook with plenty of physics, techniques and sequences. Not an easily read introduction, but suitable for physicists and similar people.

“Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy” by Paul T. Callaghan. A classic within the field of probing molecular dynamics. Technically demanding. Should only be read in the company of a grown-up.

“Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance” by Malcolm H. Levitt. Covers theoretical aspects of MR spectroscopy as used in chemical analysis and is thus irrelevant to most who work with MR image analysis. Excels in clear, coherent writing and a description of quantum mechanics devoid of typical misconceptions.
